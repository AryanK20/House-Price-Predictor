Project Description
This project aims to provide a robust model for predicting house prices in Bangalore. The prediction model is built using a supervised learning algorithm and is fine-tuned to provide accurate estimates based on the given input features. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation phases.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features that impact the price of houses in Bangalore. These features include:

Location: The area or neighborhood where the house is located.
Square Footage: The total area of the house in square feet.
Number of Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
Number of Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.
Availability: Whether the house is ready for possession or under construction.
Amenities: Additional features such as a garden, swimming pool, etc.
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data before feeding it into the model.

Features
Key features of the Bangalore House Price Predictor include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for model training.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Choosing the best machine learning model for the task, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters to achieve the best performance.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model’s accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Modeling
The model is trained on historical data and tested on a validation set to ensure accuracy. Different algorithms are explored, and the best-performing model is selected for the final predictions. The model’s performance is evaluated using various statistical metrics.
